The benefits of URC-20 tokens can be seen as:</span></p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Standardization:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The URC-20 framework simplifies the development of decentralized applications and services.</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Efficient Network Utilization:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Leveraging the U2U Network's infrastructure ensures faster transactions and reduced costs.</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Ecosystem Growth: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Encourages development and innovation, contributing to a thriving network ecosystem.</span></li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The introduction of the URC-20 token standard on U2U Network is a pivotal development in the blockchain landscape. It addresses key challenges faced by the blockchain community, especially in terms of token standardization and interoperability.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By providing a consistent framework for token creation, URC-20 enhances the user experience, reduces development complexities, and fosters a more integrated network ecosystem. Its compatibility with smart contracts opens up a myriad of possibilities for automated transactions and innovative applications, contributing significantly to the network's efficiency and scalability.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In conclusion, the URC-20 token standard is not just a technical protocol but a driving force behind innovation and usability in U2U Network, signaling a promising future for blockchain technology and digital assets.</span></p><p></p></div></article>"

It was developed as an alternative to traditional blockchain technology, with a particular focus on improving speed, scalability, and fairness in transaction confirmation.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img title=\"what-is-hashgraph-consensus\" src=\"https://uniultra.xyz/uploads/what-is-hashgraph-consensus.jpg\" alt=\"what ishashgraph consensus\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></span></p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1hdv7c63a5f\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Does Hashgraph Consensus Work?</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hashgraph employs a unique mechanism called the \"Gossip about Gossip\" and \"Virtual Voting\" algorithm to achieve consensus. Instead of bundling transactions into blocks, Hashgraph processes transactions asynchronously, allowing for near-instantaneous confirmation. This gossip protocol enables nodes to efficiently share information about transactions, leading to a highly efficient consensus mechanism.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, Alice creates a transaction with Bob, and all of the information she knows is given to him. Bob then makes a transaction with Kris. All of the information Bob has is communicated to Kris. Kris transacts with Eli, and everything she knows is transferred. This continues throughout the network, with the chain essentially gossiping about the events taking place. Every node knows what all other nodes know, so there is no need for computational validation.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img title=\"hashgraph-consensus\" src=\"https://uniultra.xyz/uploads/hashgraph-consensus.jpg\" alt=\"hashgraph consensus\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></span></p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1hdv7c63a5g\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pros and Cons of Hashgraph&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consensus</span></h2><h3 id=\"mcetoc_1hdv7c63a5h\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pros of Hashgraph Consensus</span></h3><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Speed and Scalability</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Hashgraph can handle a vast number of transactions per second, making it ideal for applications requiring high-speed transactions.</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Fairness</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Hashgraph eliminates the need for miners or validators, ensuring fair access to transaction processing.</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Security</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Its asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT) consensus provides robust security.</span></li></ul><h3 id=\"mcetoc_1hdv7c63a5i\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cons of Hashgraph Consensus</span></h3><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Patented Technology</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Hashgraph's underlying technology is patented, which raises concerns about open-source principles.</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Centralized Initialization</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: In some cases, the initialization of Hashgraph networks can be centralized, impacting its decentralized ethos.</span></li></ul><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1hdv7c63a5j\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Is Hashgraph Consensus Different From Blockchain?</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hashgraph and blockchain differ in several fundamental aspects:</span></p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Transaction Confirmation</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Hashgraph offers faster and more scalable transaction confirmation compared to blockchain's block-based approach.</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Decentralization</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Hashgraph aims to be more decentralized by avoiding the concentration of validation power in the hands of miners.</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Consensus Mechanism</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Hashgraph utilizes aBFT consensus, whereas blockchain primarily relies on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanisms.</span></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img title=\"what-is-hashgraph\" src=\"https://uniultra.xyz/uploads/what-is-hashgraph.jpg\" alt=\"what is hashgraph\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></span></p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1hdv7c63a5k\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will Hashgraph Consensus Replace Blockchain?</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Hashgraph presents significant advantages, including speed and fairness, its path to replacing blockchain entirely is uncertain.

Unlike permissionless blockchains that welcome any node without prerequisites, permissioned blockchains demand personal identification from potential members, ensuring a pre-screened and trusted network. This meticulous selection negates the need for intricate trust validation methods for nodes, simplifying the process and enhancing computational efficiency.</p><p>PoET operates on the principle of equitable distribution of winning chances among the extensive network. It mimics a fair lottery system where every node enjoys an equal opportunity to win. To uphold this fairness, the system must satisfy three essential criteria:</p><ol><li><strong>Random Waiting Time:</strong> Each node is assigned a random waiting period.</li><li><strong>Unbiased Selection:</strong> Nodes do not deliberately select the shortest waiting duration.</li><li><strong>Verification of Waiting Time Completion:</strong> The system verifies if a node has completed its designated waiting time.</li></ol><p>Integral to PoET's functionality is Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions), which plays a pivotal role by:</p><ol><li><strong>Issuing Certificates:</strong> Providing nodes with certificates that validate their authenticity and integrity, ensuring their eligibility to generate new blocks within the network.</li><li><strong>Ensuring Trusted Code Execution:</strong> Verifying that nodes execute trusted code within a secure environment through a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). This environment, shielded from external access, safeguards reserved and private storage areas, preventing inspection or alteration by other applications.</li></ol><p><img title=\"what-is-proof-of-elapsed-time\" src=\"https://uniultra.xyz/uploads/what-is-proof-of-elapsed-time.jpg\" alt=\"what is proof of elapsed time\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1hdibnb77bi\">The development of PoET</h2><p>In 2016, Intel, in partnership with the Linux Project and IBM, introduced the Hyperledger Sawtooth project, employing the PoET consensus mechanism. This innovation, designed to enhance the efficiency of enterprise applications such as supply chain and logistics, offers a scalable and flexible distributed ledger solution. The project aimed to mitigate the energy-intensive nature of the Proof of Work mining process while improving network performance.</p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1hdibnb77bj\">How does PoET work?</h2><p>In brief, PoET operates through four primary stages:</p><ol><li>Nodes in the network are allocated random waiting times.</li><li>During this waiting period, nodes either sleep or perform other tasks.</li><li>The node with the shortest waiting time awakens first and is authorized to create the block.</li><li>After block production, the node shares the information with other participants in the network.</li></ol><p>These four steps are categorized into two phases: the \"Selection Process\" and the \"Genesis Process.\"</p><h3 id=\"mcetoc_1hdibnb77bk\">Selection Process</h3><ul><li>Each node within the network will provide its Intel Software Guard Extension (SGX) certificate, validating its authority to create a new block. Once certified, the node receives a timer object.</li><li>Intel’s Random Number Generator (RAND) assigns complex, hard-to-predict random numbers to every node.</li><li>The allocated time object triggers a countdown for each participating node upon activation.</li></ul><p><img title=\"proof-of-elapsed-time\" src=\"https://uniultra.xyz/uploads/proof-of-elapsed-time.jpg\" alt=\"proof of elapsed time\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></p><h3 id=\"mcetoc_1hdibnb77bl\">Genesis Process</h3><ul><li>Once a node's timer object runs out, the node springs into action and takes on the task of creating a fresh block for the network.</li><li>The active node calculates the hash of its transaction block and sends it for verification.</li><li>Upon successful validation, the revised information is shared across the entire network.</li></ul><p><img title=\"proof-of-elapsed-time-poet\" src=\"https://uniultra.xyz/uploads/proof-of-elapsed-time-poet.jpg\" alt=\"proof of elapsed time poet\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1hdibnb77bm\">Advantages and Limitations of PoET</h2><p>Despite its aim to enhance the Proof of Work (PoW) model, PoET is not without its flaws. Similar to other methods, PoET has its own set of advantages and limitations.</p><h3 id=\"mcetoc_1hdibnb77bn\">Advantages</h3><ol><li><strong> Energy Efficiency:</strong> PoET stands out for its energy efficiency, eliminating the need for energy-intensive cryptographic puzzle mining, unlike PoW. This aligns with the global shift towards sustainable and eco-friendly blockchain technologies.</li><li><strong> Decentralization:</strong> PoET ensures a level playing field for all participants, irrespective of their computational power or capital investment, fostering true decentralization. Unlike PoW, where computational power matters, PoET promotes fairness among nodes.</li><li><strong> Scalability:</strong> PoET's efficient and predictable block creation process enhances scalability, allowing for processing a higher number of transactions within a given timeframe.</li></ol><h3 id=\"mcetoc_1hdibnb77bo\">Limitations</h3><ol><li><strong> Permissioned Network:</strong> PoET operates exclusively within closed, permissioned networks, which restricts its accessibility compared to open networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum.</li><li><strong> Specialized Hardware Requirement:</strong> Implementing PoET requires specific hardware, making it inaccessible to everyone due to the specialized equipment requirements.</li><li><strong> Compatibility Issues:</strong> PoET relies heavily on Intel Technology's tools, which might lead to compatibility problems with other software, limiting its seamless integration.</li></ol><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1hdibnb77bp\">PoET vs PoW vs PoS</h2><p>While all three are consensus mechanisms utilized in distributed ledgers, PoET distinguishes itself significantly from PoW and PoS. Here's a brief comparison between these methods.</p><p><img title=\"what-is-poet\" src=\"https://uniultra.xyz/uploads/what-is-poet.jpg\" alt=\"what is poet\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>What is Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET)? Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET) stands out as a groundbreaking consensus mechanism, distinct from widely-known methods like Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS). PoET finds its ideal application in permissioned (private) blockchains, where participants are meticulously chosen and trusted, obviating the need for intricate trust validation methods.</p><p>At the core of PoET lie principles of fairness and energy efficiency. Each network node is assigned a random waiting time, ensuring an equal opportunity to win the chance to create a new block.

    "content": "<article class=\"detail-content\"><div class=\"description\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Distributed ledgers like blockchain or hashgraph require consensus mechanisms to reach uniform agreement on the network state. The most widely known consensus mechanisms are Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Work (PoW), used by the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchain, respectively.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, over a long period of time, these original, long-lived methodologies are proved to be flawed and nonoptimal. Consequently, more innovative approaches have arisen, bringing about more complicated but productive systems. At U2U Chain, Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) is one of the three consensus techniques that we implement in our “Triple Layer Protection Mechanism” to greatly improve our chain’s performance as well as security.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this article, we will delve into Delegated Proof of Stake to learn about what is Delegated Proof of Stake, how it works, and how it is a better initiative compared to PoS and PoW.</span></p><div class=\"mce-toc\"><h6>Table of Contents</h6><ul><li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1hdgfmj4d158\">What is Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)?</a></li><li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1hdgfmj4d159\">The development of DPoS</a></li><li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1hdgfmj4d15a\">How does DPoS work?</a><ul><li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1hdgfmj4d15b\">Voters</a></li><li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1hdgfmj4d15c\">Witnesses/Block Producers</a></li><li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1hdgfmj4d15d\">Delegates</a></li><li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1hdgfmj4d15e\">Validators</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1hdgfmj4d15f\">Advantages and Limitations of DPoS</a><ul><li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1hdgfmj4d15g\">Advantages</a></li><li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1hdgfmj4d15h\">Limitations</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1hdgfmj4d15i\">DPoS vs PoS vs PoW</a></li><li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1hdgfmj4d15j\">Blockchains that use DPoS</a></li></ul></div><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1hdgfmj4d158\"><strong>What is Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)?</strong></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)? Delegated Proof of Stake is a modified version of Proof of Stake, arguably a more efficient and democratic one. Delegated Proof of Stake is similar to Proof of Stake in the sense that both follow a collateral staking system whereas the native network tokens are staked for security purposes.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nevertheless, DPoS improves the preceding mechanism by adding a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">voting and delegation process. This addition offers a more affordable, efficient, and fair way to validate transactions. In DPoS, all token holders can participate in the network and benefit from it; On the other hand, in original PoS blockchains, the value accrues to stakers/validators.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img title=\"what-is-delegated-proof-of-stake\" src=\"https://uniultra.xyz/uploads/what-is-delegated-proof-of-stake.jpg\" alt=\"what is delegated proof of stake\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></span></p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1hdgfmj4d159\"><strong>The development of DPoS</strong></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The concept of DPoS, as a variation of PoS, was first introduced by Daniel Larimer in 2014. He outlined this novel consensus mechanism in a Bitcointalk forum post. Larimer's vision was to create a more efficient and scalable consensus algorithm that could address some of the limitations of traditional PoS systems.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The DPoS concept gained practical implementation and recognition with the launch of BitShares in 2015, a cryptocurrency platform developed by Daniel Larimer. BitShares was one of the first blockchain projects to adopt the DPoS consensus algorithm.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DPoS did not remain confined to BitShares but saw further adoption in other blockchain projects. Notably, Steem and EOS embraced DPoS as their consensus mechanism. EOS, in particular, garnered substantial attention for its use of DPoS and conducted one of the largest initial coin offerings (ICOs) in the cryptocurrency space.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1hdgfmj4d15a\"><strong>How does DPoS work?</strong></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a PoS system, all nodes are involved in the workflow of the blockchain. However, DPoS involves an election system for users to vote on some specific delegates responsible for verifying and creating blocks. In this procedure, there are 4 participants: Voters, Witnesses/Block Producers, Delegates, and Validators.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img title=\"what-is-dpos\" src=\"https://uniultra.xyz/uploads/what-is-dpos.jpg\" alt=\"what is dpos\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></span></p><h3 id=\"mcetoc_1hdgfmj4d15b\"><strong>Voters</strong></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every network participant holding even the least amount of native token can become a voter. Ultimately, voters are the ones who decide the most important matters in the network, from choosing a Witness or Delegate to concluding governance proposals. Users with voting power can either cast their own votes, or delegate this right to another person. The voting power will be directly proportional to the amount of capital they have.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most concerning task for a voter is to select the Witnesses/Block Producers since they are directly involved in the block production process.</span></p><h3 id=\"mcetoc_1hdgfmj4d15c\"><strong>Witnesses/Block Producers</strong></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The nodes that are voted by token holders are called Witnesses, or Block Producers. These entities are responsible for validating transactions and creating blocks on the blockchain. Upon successful verification of all transactions in one block, the responsible witnesses receive rewards, which are then partially distributed back to the users who voted for them.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, if a Witness fails to verify all transactions in the allotted time and misses a block, they would not receive any reward. Generally, the reward for a failed Witness may be passed on to the next Witnesses if they verify all transactions. Such a process would imply that the block is “stolen”.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this way, there are incentives for both parties to act truthfully and benefit from their behaviors: users (token holders) would want to vote for a trustworthy node to earn a portion of the network reward, while Witnesses would want work honestly to earn their reputation, attract more voters, hence participating in the block production process for rewards.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interestingly enough, one does not need a large amount of capital to become a Witness. Instead, Witnesses are heavily ranked by reputation. As the voting process happens continually, Witnesses have to constantly grow their reputation and integrity to stay relevant. Since the number of selected Witnesses is usually limited at 21-101 depending on the blockchain, the competition among these peers becomes more tremendous as the network grows.</span></p><h3 id=\"mcetoc_1hdgfmj4d15d\"><strong>Delegates</strong></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delegates are another entity that are selected by users’ votes. However, unlike Witnesses who are responsible for block production, Delegates take charge of the governance. Their job is to put out improvement proposals for the network, for example changing the size of a block, or deciding the amount of block reward.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, these proposals are voted on by users before being finalized. Delegates do not have the right to apply changes directly on the system.</span></p><h3 id=\"mcetoc_1hdgfmj4d15e\"><strong>Validators</strong></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Block Validators refer to full nodes who verify that blocks created by witnesses follow the consensus rules. Any user can become a Validator; unfortunately, there is no incentive to be one.</span></p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1hdgfmj4d15f\"><strong>Advantages and Limitations of DPoS</strong></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While regarded as an improved version of PoS, DPoS still possesses its pros and cons.</span></p><h3 id=\"mcetoc_1hdgfmj4d15g\"><strong>Advantages</strong></h3><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Easily accessible: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone can participate in and benefit from a DPoS system without needing a large amount of capital or expensive equipment.</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Decentralized:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> With a low barrier of entry, the network will involve a massive number of participants, making it more decentralized, democratic, and financially inclusive.</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Highly performant and scalable:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The number of Witnesses is limited, allowing the network to reach consensus much faster, resulting in a higher throughput.</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Sustainable and environmentally-friendly:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> DPoS systems require a low level of power to operate, making it sustainable and more environmentally-friendly.</span></li></ul><h3 id=\"mcetoc_1hdgfmj4d15h\"><strong>Limitations</strong></h3><ul><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Vulnerable to malicious behaviors: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Witnesses are voted by users and users are normally heavily driven by incentives, Witnesses can add bribes during the voting process to manipulate the system.</span></li></ul><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Unreliable: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A user-oriented system means it can be easily ruined if the participants (Witnesses, Delegates,...) do not behave correctly. Human behaviors are very unpredictable and incentive-driven by nature, which can be exploited or lead to inefficiencies.</span></li><li><strong>Centralization risks:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> While the network is decentralized in the sense that all users can participate in it, it can also be very centralized because there are only a small, limited number of Witnesses/Block Producers.</span></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img title=\"delegated-proof-of-stake\" src=\"https://uniultra.xyz/uploads/delegated-proof-of-stake.jpg\" alt=\"delegated proof of stake\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></span></p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1hdgfmj4d15i\"><strong>DPoS vs PoS vs PoW</strong></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As mentioned earlier, while PoS and DPoS are similar in the sense of stakeholding, DPoS presents a novel democratic voting system by which Block Producers are elected. Since a DPoS system is maintained by the Voters, the Witnesses and Delegates are motivated and incentivized to be honest and efficient, or they will get voted out. In addition, DPoS blockchains possess a higher throughput than the PoS and PoW ones, thanks to the small, limited set of Witnesses.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, DPoS is not used in the same way as PoW or PoS. PoW is still considered the most secure consensus algorithm, and as such, is where most money transmittance occurs. PoS is faster than PoW, more environmentally-friendly, and potentially has more use cases. DPoS limits the use of staking to the election of block producers: its actual block production is predetermined in contrast to the competition-based system of PoW whereas every witness gets a turn at block production.</span></p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1hdgfmj4d15j\"><strong>Blockchains that use DPoS</strong></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PoS is currently the most popular consensus mechanism used by prominent networks, including Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, and Avalanche. However, DPoS is a little more specific and less-widely used. Some of the most popular networks using this consensus mechanism include:</span></p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>EOS</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Created by Daniel Larimer and Block.one, EOS is an open-source blockchain that offers scalability with low latency.

The need for seamless cross-border transactions and an interoperable financial ecosystem has given rise to groundbreaking technologies. One such technology is the Inter-ledger Protocol (ILP). This blog will take you on a journey to understand what is Inter-ledger Protocol (ILP), exploring its inner workings, benefits, real-world applications, and the potential it holds for the future of finance.</span></p><div class=\"mce-toc\"><h6>Table of Contents</h6><ul><li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1hdfn5c8j41\">What is Inter-ledger Protocol (ILP)?</a></li><li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1hdfn5c8j42\">How Inter-ledger Protocol Works</a></li><li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1hdfn5c8j43\">What Are the Benefits of Inter-ledger Protocol?</a></li><li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1hdfn5c8j44\">Applications of Inter-ledger Protocol</a></li><li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1hdfn5c8j45\">Future of Inter-ledger Protocol</a></li></ul></div><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1hdfn5c8j41\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is Inter-ledger Protocol (ILP)?</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>What is Inter-ledger Protocol (ILP)? </strong>Interledger Protocol, often abbreviated as ILP, is a groundbreaking technology that aims to enable secure, real-time, and cross-border transactions. It is designed to be an open protocol suite for sending payments across different payment networks, both traditional and blockchain-based. ILP focuses on interoperability, allowing various payment networks to communicate and transact seamlessly.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img title=\"what-is-inter-ledger-protocol\" src=\"https://uniultra.xyz/uploads/what-is-inter-ledger-protocol.jpg\" alt=\"what is inter-ledger protocol\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></span></p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1hdfn5c8j42\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Inter-ledger Protocol Works</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At its core, ILP employs a simple yet powerful concept. It breaks down transactions into smaller packets, each with a set value. These packets can move across various payment networks, ultimately reaching their destination and reconstructing the original payment. ILP utilizes connectors, which are essentially intermediaries responsible for routing and forwarding these packets.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine you want to send money from a bank account to a friend's mobile wallet, but they use a different payment network. ILP simplifies this process by splitting your payment into smaller packets. These packets find their way through a series of connectors, each navigating a different payment network until they reach their destination, where they are reassembled to complete the transaction. All of this happens in real time, making cross-border transactions smoother and more efficient.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img title=\"inter-ledger-protocol\" src=\"https://uniultra.xyz/uploads/inter-ledger-protocol.jpg\" alt=\"inter-ledger protocol\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></span></p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1hdfn5c8j43\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Are the Benefits of Inter-ledger Protocol?</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ILP offers a myriad of advantages that are transforming the finance industry. One of the most significant benefits is the ability to enable interoperability between various payment networks, breaking down the silos that traditionally hindered smooth transactions. This translates to faster, more efficient, and cost-effective cross-border payments.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, ILP's open nature fosters innovation. Developers and financial institutions can build upon the protocol to create new financial products and services. The decentralization aspect of ILP means that it is not controlled by a single entity, making it a trustless and secure platform.</span></p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1hdfn5c8j44\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Applications of Inter-ledger Protocol</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The potential applications of ILP are vast and impactful. For instance, ILP is being used to enable micropayments on the web, allowing users to make small payments for content and services without the friction of traditional payment methods. Furthermore, it is revolutionizing remittances, providing a more efficient and cost-effective way to send money across borders.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the world of blockchain, ILP is a key enabler for decentralized finance (DeFi). It allows users to seamlessly move assets between various blockchain networks, facilitating liquidity and reducing the complexity of managing multiple wallets and networks.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img title=\"inter-ledger-protocol-ilp\" src=\"https://uniultra.xyz/uploads/inter-ledger-protocol-ilp.jpg\" alt=\"inter-ledger protocol ilp\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></span></p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1hdfn5c8j45\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Future of Inter-ledger Protocol</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As ILP gains more recognition and adoption, its future appears promising. The protocol is continually evolving, addressing challenges and becoming more efficient. The potential use cases for ILP are still being discovered, and it is expected to play a significant role in the broader adoption of blockchain technology and the transformation of the financial sector.</span></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is Inter-ledger Protocol (ILP)?<strong> </strong>Inter-ledger Protocol (ILP) represents a pivotal advancement in the financial technology landscape. With its focus on interoperability, ILP is set to transform cross-border transactions, empower DeFi, and enable innovative financial services.

For thousands of years, paper-based use cases remained the backbone to help structure our society: money, bills, books and novels, certificates, and of course, the use of bookkeeping.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the reign of paper has now given way to digital technologies based on computing power. The booming of technology, and breakthroughs in cryptography, along with the discovery and use of some new and interesting algorithms, have allowed the creation of distributed ledgers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the simplest form, Distributed Ledger Technology or DLT refers to a technological infrastructure that uses a network of independent computers - called nodes - to record, share, and synchronize transactions into a ledger in a digital environment.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The unique characteristic of DLT is its database is not centralized storage and is controlled by a central authority. Instead, the database is encrypted and distributed to each node in a network afterward. In other words, every single node on the network processes every transaction, coming to its own conclusions and then voting on those conclusions to make certain the majority agrees with the conclusions.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This process lays the basis for the consensus algorithm concept.&nbsp; Each distributed ledger is only updated once all nodes have a consensus, and each maintains its own identical copy of the ledger. This architecture allows for a new dexterity as a system of record that goes beyond being a simple database.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img title=\"what-is-distributed-ledger-technology\" src=\"https://uniultra.xyz/uploads/what-is-distributed-ledger-technology.jpg\" alt=\"what is distributed ledger technology\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></span></p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1hd2rb3vomi\">How does the Distributed Ledger Technology work?</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Distributed ledgers are held, reorganized, and controlled by individual nodes, each node builds the database independently. Every transaction occurring on the network is processed, and a conclusion on the development of the database is created by each node.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a transaction is performed, its information will be distributed to all nodes for analysis and processing. To reach a consensus, all nodes participate in the voting, and if at least 51% of them agree, the new transaction is accepted on the database. Then, the nodes update the database versions so that all the devices or nodes will be of the same version. The new transaction is written onto a block on the DLT.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Database stored on DLT will be encrypted using cryptography, thereby ensuring that only those with the right to participate can use the data. The term \"cryptography\" also explains why digital currencies (in the blockchain) are \"cryptocurrency.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DLT is programmed so that if only one information cannot be changed, the entire database becomes immutable. Governance within the rules-based network of nodes creates a transparent and democratic environment. Along with it is its distributed, private, and encrypted nature, making it less susceptible to hacker attacks. All backups in the network are highly secured, with strict setup rules, so if criminals want to break into the ledger, they need to attack the entire ledger network simultaneously. This is considered an extremely difficult and impossible task.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img title=\"distributed-ledger-technology-dlt\" src=\"https://uniultra.xyz/uploads/distributed-ledger-technology-dlt.jpg\" alt=\"distributed ledger technology dlt\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></span></p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1hd2rb3vomj\">What does Distributed Ledger Technology use for?</h2><h3 id=\"mcetoc_1hd2rb3vomk\">1. Finance</h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The potential of DLT underscores its revolutionary role for the entire financial sector. When traditional payment systems such as VISA and SWIFT reveal some limitations, the way DLT works becomes a bright solution. Financial transactions can be done everywhere faster and cheaper, especially in places with poor infrastructure and difficulty accessing the traditional banking system.</span></p><h3 id=\"mcetoc_1hd2rb3voml\">2. Verify identity</h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The advantages of DLT - such as immutability, encryption, and security - make it an ideal solution used to identify each individual digitally. Identity verification using DLT helps prevent identity theft and data theft.</span></p><h3 id=\"mcetoc_1hd2rb3vomm\">3. Vote</h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DLT has the potential to be applied to create a secure, transparent voting system, prevent fraud during the voting process, as well as ensure the integrity of this process. Information recorded in an open, transparent, immutable ledger will be stored simultaneously. This helps improve the fairness and reliability of the process of collecting votes/opinions from many different people.</span></p><h3 id=\"mcetoc_1hd2rb3vomn\">4. Prove ownership</h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to identity verification applications, DLT can also be used to record property transactions, creating a transparent, immutable record of ownership and transfer of assets.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although there are still certain limitations when transferring ownership of real physical assets to a distributed ledger, this type of ledger can still convey an immutable source of information about property ownership.</span></p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1hd2rb3vomo\">What are the pros and cons of Distributed Ledger Technology?</h2><h3 id=\"mcetoc_1hd2rb3vomp\">Advantage of DLT</h3><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Secure, tamper-proof, and immutable:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In DLT, the entries happen in the database without third-party involvement. After records are written into distributed ledgers, they cannot be altered by any other party. Hence, until the ledgers are distributed, the records cannot be tampered with.</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Third-party is eliminated:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In the supply chain business, results can be written directly without needing a third party. It saves a considerable amount of money, effort, and time.</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Enhance decentralized:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The inherently decentralized nature of DLT now adds another layer of security. As the database is spread globally, it is difficult to attack.</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Highly transparent:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> DLT presents a high level of transparency. They allow all the stored information to be freely and easily viewable. It provides a significant amount of transparency desired by many industries.</span></li></ul><h3 id=\"mcetoc_1hd2rb3vomq\">Disadvantage of DLT</h3><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Inefficiency:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp; When a network of DLT is congested, processing can be slow, and a transaction may require more fees.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Energy:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The way DLT works requires nodes to process at the same time, meaning computers must operate simultaneously. Therefore, it consumes energy - such as electricity - in extremely large amounts.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Can't be reversible:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Since DLT is immutable, transactions aren't reversible, which can be good or bad. The recipient of a payment doesn't need to worry about the sender performing a chargeback like they can with other payment methods. But this also means the sender has no recourse in the event of fraud.</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>A 51% attack:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This risk refers to bad actors controlling at least 51% of the network and being able to manipulate it. With the largest cryptocurrencies, it's practically impossible. Smaller networks, on the other hand, could be more at risk.</span></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img title=\"what-is-dlt\" src=\"https://uniultra.xyz/uploads/what-is-dlt.jpg\" alt=\"what is dlt\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></span></p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1hd2rb3vomr\">Why is Distributed Ledger Technology important?</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DLT can make the finance sector more resilient, efficient, and reliable. The technology can be used to improve features of the finance sector, such as processing transactions without third-party involvement and cross-border payments.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DLT holds many benefits over more traditional centralized ledger systems. Because DLT is a decentralized system, there is no central point of control or failure. This makes DLT more resilient to attacks and less vulnerable to system-wide failures.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DLT can be classified as either public or private, depending on the accessibility of the ledgers by anyone or by the devices (also called nodes). It can also be categorized as permissioned or permissionless, based on whether participants require permission from a certain entity to edit the ledgers.</span></p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1hd2rb3voms\">How different between DLT and Blockchain?</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As posed in the beginning, while often considered homogeneous, DLT and Blockchain are distinct – though subtly different – technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A distributed ledger is a record of consensus with a cryptographic audit trail which is maintained and validated by several separate nodes. This cryptographically assured and synchronized data can be spread across multiple institutions. Distributed ledgers can be either decentralized, granting equal rights within the protocol to all participants, or centralized, designating certain users' particular rights. Actors typically employ distributed ledgers when they need a tool that permits concurrent editing of a shared state while maintaining its unicity. The ledger’s state is determined through a consensus algorithm, which can vary in its mechanics but ultimately serves to validate information from inputs to the network.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Blockchain data structure has a shared, replicated ledger comprised of digitally recorded and unchangeable data in packages called \"blocks.\" A blockchain sits below a distributed ledger and acts as a way to order and validate the transactions in the ledger. While a blockchain automatically produces a new “block” after certain predetermined criteria are met, a distributed ledger only verifies a transaction once it is submitted instead of pushing out empty blocks.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In short, a distributed ledger is a record of consensus with a cryptographic audit trail maintained and validated by nodes. It can be decentralized or centralized. </span><strong>Blockchain is a way to implement a Distributed Ledger, but not all Distributed Ledgers necessarily employ blockchains.</strong></p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1hd2rb3vomt\">The Future of Distributed Ledger Technology</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The invention of distributed ledgers represents a revolution in how information is gathered and communicated. It applies to both static data (a registry) and dynamic data (transactions). Distributed Ledger Technology allows users to move beyond the simple custodianship of a database and divert energy to how we use, manipulate, and extract value from databases.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now and in the future, Distributed Ledger Technology is transforming the digital world by allowing organizations to securely store, transfer, and manage data in a distributed, decentralized, and secure manner. It also could reshape capital markets. From securities issuance to settlement, trading, and servicing, DLT creates benefits that include faster processing, more transparency, lower costs, and reduced risks.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, this era is witnessing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have more adoption, leading humanity into an era where digital technology drives every movement of sociality. The potential of DLT and its power even beyond cryptocurrency; therefore, looking forward, DLT owns a bright future as long as developers constantly explore and upgrade it.</span></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The insight about <strong>what is Distributed Ledger Technology</strong> may not have been provided more thoroughly in this article. However, this article has outlined the most basic scope of the concept of DLT, through which viewers can grasp the essence of this promising technology.

Essentially, a blockchain is a decentralized ledger that records transactions across a distributed network of “nodes”. Each node in the network is treated as an equal “peer”, with no central authority controlling the system. Instead, each peer is connected to another, forming a decentralized network of nodes that validate, verify, and publicize data themselves without requiring an intermediary.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img title=\"gossip-about-gossip-1\" src=\"https://uniultra.xyz/uploads/gossip-about-gossip-1.jpg\" alt=\"gossip about gossip 1\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to verify the integrity of these decentralized ledger networks, each node has to store the complete version of the ledger and constantly communicate with other nodes. This ensures that the correct version of the ledger is always available on each and every node. In case anything suddenly happens, any participant can easily verify and restore the original ledger. At the same time, the data will always be guaranteed to be trustful and up-to-date, even when some actors behave maliciously.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is when the difficulty arises. Storing the data of the ledger is one thing, but continually transferring these data across different nodes may pose some serious problems (e.g. bandwidth). Therefore, an effective data communication method is crucial in such a system. We would want an approach that allows a rapid pace of data transmission while still maintaining a high level of security in the process.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is when the gossip protocol comes into play. As the name suggests, a gossip protocol takes place when information is transmitted from one peer to another until it is eventually spread all across the network.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s take a look at how this mechanism works via an example.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img title=\"gossip-about-gossip-2\" src=\"https://uniultra.xyz/uploads/gossip-about-gossip-2.jpg\" alt=\"gossip about gossip 2\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine Alice wants to send data (a message in this case) to all other network participants. The arguably fastest yet secure way to do this is to spread the message to a random person. In this specific scenario, Alice sends the message to Dave.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img title=\"gossip-about-gossip-3\" src=\"https://uniultra.xyz/uploads/gossip-about-gossip-3.jpg\" alt=\"gossip about gossip 3\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, both Alice and Dave have the same message. They will both choose another random person to receive the message. Similarly, Alice sends the message to Gina while Dave sends the message to Bob. The process goes at an exponential rate, and after only 3 iterations, all 8 participants will have received the message.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img title=\"gossip-about-gossip-4\" src=\"https://uniultra.xyz/uploads/gossip-about-gossip-4.jpg\" alt=\"gossip about gossip 4\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This method of randomly assigning a receiver for the message is efficient in the sense that:</span></p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is simple yet really fast. The speed of messages being sent out is exponential.</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no bottleneck. The interaction between participants is divided into separate pairs, meaning there cannot exist any interceptions between any peers to form bottlenecks.</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is still extremely safe, because in case any participants stop transferring the message, the message will still be transmitted out by other participants at an exponential velocity.</span></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, regardless of this approach being astonishingly speedy yet secure, there exists a problem with it: ordering.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s try to change the number of messages being sent from 1 to 3.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img title=\"gossip-about-gossip-5\" src=\"https://uniultra.xyz/uploads/gossip-about-gossip-5.jpg\" alt=\"gossip about gossip 5\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, the issue becomes apparent. Even though the messages are delivered to the whole network really fast, the order of those messages is confusing. Every participant has had the same set of messages, but how can the network reach a consensus on the messages’ time of arrival for each peer? This is troublesome because ordering matters a lot for most applications (for example, trading) in a financial market like crypto.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The solution for this is an upgrade to “gossip about gossip”.</span></p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1hd09sstq13\"><strong>What is gossip about gossip?</strong></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gossip about gossip takes an extra step from the original methodology. Instead of gossiping about the message to others, an individual will gossip about the whole history of all “events”. Upon completion of a gossip sync, each participating member commemorates the gossip sync with an event. An event is stored in memory as a data structure composed of a timestamp, an array of zero or more transactions, two parent hashes, and a cryptographic signature.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, in the gossiping process, the sender will deliver not only a single message or piece of information, but about everything that has happened on the ledger. In this way, the latest receiver will always have the fullest information, including the order of messages or the timestamp of any particular message.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This technique is made possible by expressing the history of events via a “hashgraph” - a type of directed acyclic graph (DAG). The hashgraph is another Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) like blockchain, which grows directionally over time as more “gossip syncs” take place and events are created (A gossip sync refers to the synchronization of information between two members through the gossip protocol). Similarly, all nodes in the network keep a local copy of the hashgraph which continues to update as the gossip goes on.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img title=\"gossip-about-gossip-6\" src=\"https://uniultra.xyz/uploads/gossip-about-gossip-6.jpg\" alt=\"gossip about gossip 6\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></span></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All and all, <strong>gossip about gossip</strong> is an exceptionally effective tool when it comes to data transmission/communication, arguably the fastest and safest way to.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Unicorn Ultra, we power our U2U Chain with gossip about gossip and hashgraph to efficiently communicate data between the nodes in our system, allowing us to achieve incredible results with performance.

Cryptocurrency wallets do not directly hold a user's funds; instead, they store the public key for transaction setup and the private key for transaction authorization.</p><p>As the name implies, a custodial wallet involves a third party assuming responsibility for safeguarding users' private keys. This third party gains complete control over the cryptocurrency assets, managing the user's wallet key, executing transaction signatures, and safeguarding the user's cryptocurrency holdings.</p><ul><li>Typically, custodial wallets are offered by cryptocurrency exchanges or specialized custodial wallet providers through mobile or web applications. Once users log into their wallet accounts, they utilize the provider's interface to oversee their assets and conduct transactions.</li><li>This arrangement necessitates users placing trust in the service provider to securely store their tokens and implement robust security measures to thwart unauthorized access. These security measures may encompass two-factor authentication (2FA), email confirmation, and biometric authentication methods such as facial recognition or fingerprint verification.</li></ul><h3 id=\"mcetoc_1h6t98d6on\">Non-Custodial Wallets</h3><p>A non-custodial wallet, also known as a self-custody wallet, places the full responsibility of managing cryptocurrency funds squarely on the owner. In this setup, the user exercises complete authority over their crypto holdings, administers their private key, and conducts transactions autonomously.</p><ul><li>Non-custodial wallets manifest in various forms. Browser-based wallets function as browser extensions, permitting users to input their private keys and initiate transactions. Mobile wallets take the form of downloadable mobile applications. In contrast, hardware wallets are tangible devices, often regarded as the most secure option due to their offline accessibility.</li><li>Non-custodial wallets furnish users with a seed phrase. When establishing the wallet, users are prompted to record and safeguard a set of 12 randomly generated words, referred to as a 'recovery,' 'seed,' or 'mnemonic' phrase. This phrase serves as the foundation for generating public and private keys, also functioning as a backup and recovery mechanism in the event of users losing access to their original device. Possession of the seed phrase equates to full control over the funds held within a user's wallet. Should the seed phrase be misplaced, users forfeit access to their funds.</li><li>Users assume the responsibility for managing and executing each transaction. Private keys are indispensable for sending funds and completing various transactions. Depending on the specific non-custodial wallet in use, transactions can occur in real-time on the blockchain or be signed offline and subsequently uploaded to the blockchain for confirmation.</li></ul><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1h6t98d6oi\">Wallet Overview</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img title=\"Custodial vs Non-Custodial Wallets\" src=\"https://uniultra.xyz/uploads/custodial-vs-non-custodial-wallets.jpg\" alt=\"Custodial vs Non-Custodial Wallets\" width=\"100%\"></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A digital wallet is a virtual container that allows users to store their cryptocurrencies and interact with blockchain-based platforms. These wallets consist of a combination of public and private keys, enabling users to make secure transactions and access their holdings. In the Web3 ecosystem, where decentralization is a core principle, the choice between custodial and non-custodial wallets becomes critical.</span></p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1h6t98d6oj\">The Importance of Wallets for Web3 Developers</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Web3 developers play a crucial role in creating and maintaining decentralized applications. These developers often deal with cryptocurrencies and need reliable wallets to streamline their workflow. Wallets offer a convenient gateway for developers to manage funds, interact with smart contracts, and test their dApps on different blockchain networks. Whether it's deploying a new smart contract or testing blockchain integrations, a wallet is an essential tool for every Web3 developer.</span></p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1h6t98d6ok\">Wallet Providers</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Numerous wallet providers compete in the market, catering to the diverse needs of users. Some popular names include MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, Ledger, and Trezor, among others. These providers offer various wallet types, each with its unique features and services.</span></p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1ha98sp1b1\"><strong>Conclusion: Choosing Between Custodial and Non-Custodial Wallets</strong></h2><p><img title=\"Custodial vs Non-Custodial Wallets\" src=\"https://uniultra.xyz/uploads/Crypto-Wallets-Custodial-vs-Non-Custodial-Wallets.jpg\" alt=\"Custodial vs Non-Custodial Wallets\" width=\"100%\"></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The battle between <strong>custodial vs non-custodial wallets</strong> continues to shape the landscape of Web3. Each type of wallet comes with its own set of merits and caters to distinct user preferences. Custodial wallets provide ease of use and customer support, while non-custodial wallets offer security and decentralization. For Web3 developers, the choice depends on the specific needs of their projects and their stance on financial autonomy.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the Web3 space continues to evolve, the development of innovative wallet solutions will undoubtedly progress. Whether you opt for custodial convenience or embrace the principles of non-custodial wallets, remember to prioritize security and stay aligned with the decentralized vision that Web3 brings to the world of cryptocurrencies and dApps.</span></p><p></p></div></article>"

It operates offline, meaning it is not connected to the internet during normal use. Cold wallets store private keys, which are required to access and manage your crypto assets, in an isolated and secure environment. They offer the highest level of security due to their offline nature, making them less susceptible to hacking attempts and online threats.</span></p><h3 id=\"mcetoc_1h3vt675ck\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advantages of Cold Wallets</span></h3><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>- Enhanced Security:</strong> The main advantage of cold wallets is their high level of security. Since they are offline, they are not vulnerable to online attacks or hacking attempts. Private keys never leave the device, minimizing the risk of exposure.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>- Protection against Malware:</strong> Cold wallets provide protection against malware or keyloggers that may be present on your computer or mobile device. Since the private keys are stored on the hardware wallet itself, they are not exposed to potential threats on your computer.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>- User Control:</strong> With a cold wallet, you have complete control over your private keys and funds. You are not reliant on third-party services, reducing the risk of your assets being compromised due to a service provider's security breach.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>- Versatility:</strong> Cold wallets support a wide range of cryptocurrencies, making them suitable for users with diverse portfolios. They offer compatibility with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 id=\"mcetoc_1h3vt675cl\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is a Hot Wallet?</span></h3><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A hot wallet, also known as a software wallet or online wallet, is a digital wallet that operates on internet-connected devices such as computers, smartphones, or tablets. It allows users to access their crypto assets conveniently and facilitates quick transactions. Hot wallets store private keys online or on a connected device, making them more susceptible to security risks compared to cold wallets.</span></p><h3 id=\"mcetoc_1h3vt675cm\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advantages of Hot Wallets</span></h3><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>- Accessibility and Convenience:</strong> Hot wallets provide easy accessibility to your crypto assets. You can manage your funds and make transactions on the go using a mobile app or through a web interface. They offer a user-friendly experience and are suitable for frequent trading or spending on cryptocurrencies.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>- Instant Transactions:</strong> Hot wallets allow for quick transactions since they are connected to the internet. This makes them ideal for users who require instant access to their funds and need to execute transactions promptly.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>- Multi-device Compatibility:</strong> Hot wallets can be used across multiple devices, enabling seamless synchronization of your crypto assets. You can access your wallet from your computer, smartphone, or tablet, providing flexibility in managing your funds.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>- Additional Features:</strong> Hot wallets often come with additional features such as integration with decentralized applications (DApps), staking, or lending platforms, providing users with expanded functionality and opportunities to engage in the broader crypto ecosystem.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"hot wallet vs cold wallet\" src=\"https://uniultra.xyz/uploads/hot-wallet-vs-cold-wallet.jpg\" alt=\"hot-wallet-vs-cold-wallet\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1h3vt675cn\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hot wallet vs cold wallet - Which is better?</span></h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When deciding between a cold wallet and a hot wallet, it's important to consider your specific needs and preferences. Here are some factors to consider:</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>- Security:</strong> If security is your top priority and you plan to hold a significant amount of crypto assets for the long term, a cold wallet is the recommended choice. It provides the highest level of protection against online threats.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>- Convenience and Accessibility:</strong> If you frequently make transactions or need instant access to your funds, a hot wallet is more suitable. It offers convenience and flexibility for managing your crypto assets on the go.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>- Risk Tolerance:</strong> Assess your risk tolerance level and the amount of control you desire over your private keys. Cold wallets give you full control, while hot wallets require some level of trust in the wallet provider's security measures.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"cold wallet and hot wallet\" src=\"https://uniultra.xyz/uploads/cold-wallet-and-hot-wallet.jpg\" alt=\"cold-wallet-and-hot-wallet\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></span></p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1h5p6ra5hu\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to secure your wallet?</span></h2><p>Securing your cryptocurrency wallet is of utmost importance to protect your digital assets from theft or unauthorized access. Whether you use a hardware wallet, software wallet, or mobile wallet, here are essential security practices to follow:</p><p><strong>- Choose a Reputable Wallet:</strong> Use well-established and reputable wallet providers to reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities or scams. Research and read reviews before selecting a wallet.</p><p><strong>- Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> If your wallet supports two-factor authentication, enable it. 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second verification method (e.g., SMS code, authenticator app) in addition to your password.</p><p><strong>- Use Strong Passwords:</strong> Create a strong and unique password for your wallet. Avoid using common phrases or easily guessable information.

In this beginner's guide to crypto wallets, we'll explore the different types of wallets available, how they work, and the best practices for keeping your cryptocurrency secure. Whether you're a seasoned cryptocurrency investor or just getting started, understanding how to use a crypto wallet is essential for safely storing and managing your digital assets.</p><div class=\"mce-toc\"><h6>Table of Contents</h6><ul><li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1h47jiq76f\">What is a crypto wallet?</a></li><li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1h47jiq77g\">Why use a crypto wallet?</a></li><li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1h47jiq77h\">How does a crypto wallet work</a></li><li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1h47jiq77i\">Types of Crypto Wallets</a></li><li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1h5peh1el4m\">How to use crypto wallet?</a></li><li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1h5peh1el4n\">How to secure a crypto wallet?</a></li><li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1h5peh1el4o\">How to fix errors when using a cryptocurrency wallet?</a></li><li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1h47jiq77j\">What to consider when picking a wallet</a></li></ul></div><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1h47jiq76f\" style=\"text-align: left;\">What is a crypto wallet?</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A crypto wallet is a specialized device that securely stores and manages your private keys, which are unique strings of cryptographic letters and numbers that authorize transactions. Unlike a traditional wallet, it is not a physical container that holds all your crypto assets in one place with old receipts and coupons. Instead, it operates like an intelligent key chain that manages the keys required to move funds from one secured box to another. With advancements in user-interface technology, the process is seamless and requires no direct interaction with the keys.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Furthermore, a crypto wallet typically provides a user-friendly platform that simplifies the transaction process. It allows you to store cryptocurrencies from various blockchain networks and communicates with the specific blockchain each time you initiate a transaction. Once the transaction is confirmed, the wallet sends a notification asking for your signature to complete the action.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In addition to storing private keys, new smart contract crypto wallets provide access to decentralized applications (dapps) and the Web3 economy, allowing users to participate in the new digital landscape. Utilizing a cryptocurrency wallet also grants individuals financial sovereignty and aligns with the core values of cryptocurrencies. Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous creator of Bitcoin, designed cryptocurrency to enable peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a third party. Therefore, using a crypto wallet enables users to participate in the decentralized economy and achieve financial freedom.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"crypto wallet\" src=\"https://uniultra.xyz/uploads/crypto-wallet.jpg\" alt=\"crypto-wallet\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\">&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1h47jiq77g\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Why use a crypto wallet?</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">When using a personal crypto wallet, individuals are granted the unique opportunity to become their own bank, providing a secure means to store a portion of their wealth without relying on a third-party custodian such as a bank or centralized exchange. This innovative approach to finance allows users to avoid the pitfalls of poor security practices or mismanagement of funds that have plagued the cryptocurrency industry. The use of a crypto wallet eliminates the ability of centralized platforms to rehypothecate user funds and manipulate the value of specific assets. However, it is important to note that financial sovereignty carries a significant level of personal responsibility. Individuals who choose self-custody must familiarize themselves with the necessary steps to ensure the safety and protection of their assets to avoid any potential loss.</p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1h47jiq77h\" style=\"text-align: left;\">How does a crypto wallet work</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A cryptocurrency wallet is an essential tool for anyone looking to interact with the underlying blockchain. Typically, a user generates a unique private key (similar to a secret bank pin) and a public key (similar to a bank account number) when they first use a cryptocurrency wallet to conduct transactions.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">It's important to note that a cryptocurrency wallet does not actually hold the coins or assets themselves. Instead, it stores the private and public keys associated with the user's address(es) on the blockchain. By using these keys, users can quickly sign a transaction to prove ownership of assets and transfer them from one address to another.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In addition to facilitating transactions, a crypto wallet provides users with a suite of tools for managing their crypto assets seamlessly. Users can generate new addresses, initiate transfers, track their portfolio balances, and even buy and sell cryptocurrencies using a fiat gateway, all through the user-friendly interface of the wallet. By providing these features and more, cryptocurrency wallets play a critical role in enabling people to engage with the rapidly evolving world of digital currencies.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"crypto wallets\" src=\"https://uniultra.xyz/uploads/crypto-wallets.jpg\" alt=\"crypto-wallets\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\">&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1h47jiq77i\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Types of Crypto Wallets</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Mobile wallets</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Mobile wallets are typically free applications available for download on Android or iOS devices, allowing users to start using them within minutes. Popular options such as Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, Coinomi, and Metamask Mobile provide excellent user experiences for crypto investors by allowing them to send and receive cryptocurrencies, shop online, and sometimes interact with decentralized applications.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Web wallets (exchange wallets)</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Web wallets, also known as Web3 wallets, are browser extensions used for exchanging cryptocurrencies and connecting with decentralized applications, including those used in decentralized finance and gaming applications. Most web wallets are also free to use and support leading blockchains like Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, and BNB Chain. Examples of popular web wallets include Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, Phantom, and Trust Wallet.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Desktop wallets</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Desktop wallets are applications designed for operating systems like macOS, Linux, and Windows that enable users to store their digital assets. They typically come equipped with features to generate a private key file, which is used to recover funds in case of device failure. Popular examples of desktop wallets include Atomic Wallet, Exodus, Electrum, Coinomi, and Bitcoin Core.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Hardware wallets</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Hardware wallets are physical devices equipped with specialized chips for the secure storage of cryptographic keys. Most hardware wallets are designed to store private keys offline, and transactions are signed in this mode. Once signed, the transaction data is transmitted via an encrypted connection to the blockchain. Popular hardware wallet brands include Ledger and Trezor, both of which are widely used among cryptocurrency investors. In recent years, newer devices like Casa and the Ngrave Zero have also gained popularity, thanks to their advanced features and growing market appeal.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Cold storage wallets</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Cold storage wallets are hardware wallets designed to hold crypto assets for the long term and are not intended for regular transactions. They provide an offline storage solution for private keys, which significantly reduces the risk of losing funds to online attackers. By storing the private key offline, cold storage wallets ensure the safety of the cryptocurrency, even if the computer or device connected to the internet is compromised.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Multi-signature wallets</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Multi-signature wallets require multiple cryptographic signatures to approve a transaction. This feature provides an additional layer of security and distributed ownership, making it difficult for hackers to steal funds. Atomic Wallet and Electrum (desktop wallets) are some examples of wallets that offer multi-signature support. Moreover, mobile wallets like Casa and BitPay also provide the same feature, which is beneficial for users who frequently use their smartphones to manage their cryptocurrencies. With the increasing security concerns associated with the storage of crypto assets, multi-signature wallets have become a popular choice for individuals and businesses seeking additional protection for their digital assets.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Paper wallets</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A paper wallet is a straightforward yet secure method for storing cryptocurrency, consisting of a piece of paper with your private and public key addresses written on it. This allows users to receive and transfer coins by generating a wallet address and keeping the paper in a safe place. If necessary, the assets can be retrieved by restoring the private key on a mobile or desktop wallet and transferring the coins to a new address.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Despite being regarded as an outdated way to store cryptocurrencies, paper wallets still have their uses in certain situations, such as gifting cryptocurrencies or setting up a temporary cold storage solution.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>ERC-20 wallets</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">ERC-20 wallets are essential for managing Ethereum-based tokens. Ethereum Request for Comment 20 (ERC-20) is the standard for creating fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. ERC-20 compatible wallets are designed to allow users to manage ether (ETH), the native currency of the Ethereum network, as well as ERC-20 tokens.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Most mobile and desktop wallets are ERC-20 compatible. However, the best ERC-20 wallets are those that provide advanced features and high-security standards, such as Metamask, MyEtherWallet, and Coinbase Wallet. These wallets offer additional features like integration with decentralized applications, compatibility with hardware wallets, and the ability to swap tokens within the wallet.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"what is a crypto wallet\" src=\"https://uniultra.xyz/uploads/what-is-a-crypto-wallet.jpg\" alt=\"what-is-a-crypto-wallet\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\"></p><h2 id=\"mcetoc_1h5peh1el4m\" style=\"text-align: left;\">How to use crypto wallet?</h2><p>Using a cryptocurrency wallet is essential for securely storing, sending, and receiving digital assets.
